# Cyberbullying Detection System Using BERT

A deep learning–based solution to detect and classify cyberbullying on social media platforms using advanced NLP techniques.

## 💡 Overview

This project uses a fine-tuned BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model combined with VADER sentiment analysis to detect harmful content in real time. It classifies cyberbullying into categories like gender-based, religious, age-related, and more. A mobile app (Flutter) and web-based admin panel (Django) are included to support users and moderators.
